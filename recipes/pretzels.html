        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>"Wow! These were really good," says KATIEINOK. "I grew up in Germany and loved the pretzels there, and these
            pretzels tasted like I was back there in Bavaria!"</p>
        <p>Fun to make, traditional pretzels are great with a nice mug of beer!</p>

    <section class="ingredients"><h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 ⅓ cups water</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons baking soda</li>
            <li>3 cups water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon coarse sea salt, or to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, stir together 1 cup of flour, yeast, sugar, 2 tablespoons of butter, and 1 1/3 cup
                water. Let this mixture stand until bubble begin to form, about 15 minutes. Stir in the salt and
                gradually stir in the remaining flour until dough can be picked up and kneaded on the counter. Knead
                until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes, adding more flour if needed.
            </li>
            <li>Divide the dough into 6 pieces and let them rest for a few minutes. Roll out one piece at a time into a
                rope about 15 inches long. Loop and twist into that cool pretzel shape. Set on a baking sheet while you
                roll out the remaining portions.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (220 degrees C). Bring the remaining 3 cups of water to a boil and add
                the baking soda. Remove from the heat. Dip pretzels into the water bath for about 45 seconds, flipping
                over about halfway through. Place the soaked pretzels on a greased baking sheet. Brush them with melted
                butter and sprinkle with coarse salt.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
