        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>"Absolutely the MOST delicious hot German Potato Salad we've ever eaten," says Mom, What's for Dinner? "I
            increased the recipe for an Oktoberfest party."</p>
        <p>This is my mother's recipe. Everyone, German or not, loves it. It is easy to double the recipe as well. I
            often bring it to potlucks, and we also have it at home on special occasions. There are usually no
            leftovers, but if there are, they don't last long!</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the potatoes into a pot, and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook for about
                10 minutes, or until easily pierced with a fork. Drain, and set aside to cool.
            </li>
            <li>Place the bacon in a large deep skillet over medium-high heat. Fry until browned and crisp, turning as
                needed. Remove from the pan and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>Add onion to the bacon grease, and cook over medium heat until browned. Add the vinegar, water, sugar,
                salt and pepper to the pan. Bring to a boil, then add the potatoes and parsley. Crumble in half of the
                bacon. Heat through, then transfer to a serving dish. Crumble the remaining bacon over the top, and
                serve warm.
